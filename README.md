# Backend of [Chattitude](https://chattitude.herokuapp.com)
> This is a TypeScript and a better structured version of [old Chattitude](https://github.com/thedenisnikulin/chattitude-app-old)
> Also, check out the [frontend](https://github.com/thedenisnikulin/chattitude-app-frontend) of the app.

## Used technologies:
* language: **Typescript**
* web framework: **expresss.js**
* ORM: **sequelize**
* auth is based on **JWT**
* chat is built with **socket.io**

I tried my best to add a lot of OOP stuff in the project, and eventually, I ended up with a pretty organized code structure.
